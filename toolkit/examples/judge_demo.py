See the REAL Anthropic judge score a recap today — no recap pipeline needed.

Setup (PowerShell), from a folder that also has the UPDATED ceo_report.py
(apply eval-judge-anthropic.patch to ceos-enterprise first, then copy
reporter/ceo_report.py here):

    $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "<your anthropic key>"
    # optional, to also post the score to the live dashboard:
    $env:REPORT_SECRET = "<REPORT_SECRET from Vercel>"

Run:
    python judge_demo.py                  # judge the built-in sample, print score
    python judge_demo.py my_recap.txt     # judge a file's contents
    python judge_demo.py my_recap.txt --report   # also post the score to the dashboard

CRITERIA = """\
Grade this end-of-day options/markets recap on:
1. Faithfulness — every number (prices, %, P/L, tickers) is supported by the
   day's actual market data. Penalize ANY invented or unverifiable figure hard.
2. Completeness — covers the day's key movers, the portfolio's positions and
   P/L, and any triggered watch-list levels. Missing a held position is a major gap.
3. Calibration — claims are appropriately hedged; no overconfident directional
   calls stated as fact. Reward reasoning, penalize hype.
4. Actionability — a reader could act on it: clear next-day levels or flags.
Score 1.0 only if all four hold. Drop fast for hallucinated numbers.
