Smoke-test the eval reporting pipe end to end.

Posts a few sample quality scores for the `finance` agent to the live
ceos-enterprise dashboard, so you can confirm report -> registry -> eval_runs
-> Fleet Quality card all work BEFORE wiring your real recap pipeline.

Run from a folder that also contains `ceo_report.py`
(copy it from ceos-enterprise/reporter/ceo_report.py), with the secret set:

    PowerShell:
        $env:REPORT_SECRET = "<same value as REPORT_SECRET in Vercel>"
        python smoke_eval.py

Cleanup later (optional): the rows are tagged 'pipeline smoke test' in eval_runs,
so you can DELETE FROM eval_runs WHERE summary = 'pipeline smoke test'; if you want
them gone once real data flows.
